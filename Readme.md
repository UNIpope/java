Topic analyser:

This tool will allow you to detect whether a set of documents are “about” the same topic or not. 
The tool will analyse the words in each document and decide what the most common words are in each document.

Assignment OO Programming Sem 2   2018 Java: 
“Stop” words should be excluded from the analysis (this is the list of words that don’t really add 
meaning which are not included in the similarity measure such as “the”, “a”, “of” “he”.. etc.
Sets of stop words can be found online (for example at : https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords)
Basic on the overlap in the top X words (e.g. 10), a grade of likelihood of it being about the same topic can be produced 
(e.g. 70% overlap in the top ten words = 70% likely to be about the same topic or whatever way you decide to do this).
Additional  features that could be included to include marks would be things such as:
•Having a GUI to run things and display the results.
•Having the ability to select documents through a “File Chooser”  GUI, with graphical results rather than just console
•Allowing words which appear on the list as  common across documents but which are obviously not informative about the topic
to be added to the stop word list, and the analysis re-run. 
•Saving down the results persistently to a file, with the overlapping words written out too.
•What else can you come up with?
